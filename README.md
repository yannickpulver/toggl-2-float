# Toggl ðŸ‘‰ Float
Handy desktop app to transfer Toggl times to Float. It lets you start toggl timers for the float tasks you have planned this week.

## Features

- Sync Float Projects, Phases & Tasks to Toggl.
- Add Toggl Time Entries to Float. (Handy buttons for entries in the last 2 weeks)
- Start Toggl Timers based on Weekly Time Schedule.
 
## Installation
1. Download the latest release (either for Windows or Mac).
2. For Mac: You might have to run `sudo xattr -cr /Applications/Toggl2Float.app` because the app is currently unsigned
3. Install the app and launch. You will be guided through getting the following:
   - Get the Float API token (has to be Admin token, as Float currently does not support User tokens)
   - Get the Toggl API token
